The variables include origin, year, month, day, hour, temp, dewp, humid,
wind_dir, wind_speed, wind_gust, precip, pressure, visib, time_hour.
This dataset has 358 rows and 15 columns. The mean temperature is
39.58F.

Important variables are:  
`time_hour`:the time of recording (hourly), it’s showing year-month-day
and time in EST e.g. “2013-01-01 01:00:00 EST”  
`temp`: temperature in F, ranges from 24.08 to 57.92  
`humid`: relative humidity, worte in percentage, 59.4 means 59.4%

``` r
library(ggplot2)

``` r
ggplot(early_january_weather, aes(x=time_hour, y=temp, color=humid))+
geom_point() +

    title = "Temperature vs Time in Early January",
    x = "Time (hourly)",
    y = "Temperature (F)",
    color = "Humidity"
  )

    ## Saving 7 x 5 in image

The scatterplot shows how temperatures fluctuates during early days of
January. The temperatures range between mid-20s to mid-50s F. It shows a
cycle of waming the cooling throughout the day. Temperature shows an
general increasing trend from the beginning of January to mid-January.
